# Transmissivity-Inversion
The author of this repository is Jiong Zhu.

This repository contains files that allow us to invert heterogeneous transmissivity in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional (1-D) confined aquifer from time-domain or frequency-domain perspectives.

The code is shared as a part of a submission to WRR journal (DOI will be updated after the publication).

If any parts of the code are used or reproduced the original source and the author must be cited.

Any questions can be addressed to the author @zhujiong@whu.edu.cn


The program consists of three different inversion methods:
1. Deterministic inversion: a deterministic inversion for a two-zone T distribution
2. Representative flow parameters estimation: statistical inferring of representative T
3. Geostatistical inversion: mapping the spatial distribution of T using geostatistical inversion.
